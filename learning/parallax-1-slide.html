      <h1 id="projectname">Omnio</h1>
      <h1>is a global technology partner for banks, building societies, and credit unions; they help ‘bankify’&nbsp;enterprises.</h1>
      <p>The ask was to create an interface for a financial technology that plugs in, works and flows. The app should have a clear UX that can be used by a diverse audience of multiple clients. It should be customizable so it can change its flavor (colors/fonts/icons/imagery) accordingly. The app should support different European languages. <br> <br>Their first client would be Austrian Post AG. Due to a shorter deadline –– the first app would have their branding applied. <br><br>We kicked off the project with an onsite workshop at the client’s office in London. Discussed the features and limitations of the technology. I’ve led two other designers on the team, delegating tasks to each of them and giving feedback on the taken decisions.</p>

    <p id="section2_p_left">The app had to be delivered in German language. But since none of us spoke German, we wrote all the copies in English so it’s easily understood what elements we’re referring to when syncing between designers –– developers –– testers –– PMs.</p>
    <p id="section2_p_right">Had an excel document with translations from English to German from the Post AG people. It was fun seeing how long the german words are and nice that we could test the designs with longer words.</p>
    <h1 id="section2p">Overall, the app provides a clear and basic user experience. It can be easily plugged into other banks without being recognized and that’s exactly what the client was looking for.</h1>
