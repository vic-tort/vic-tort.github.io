    <h1 id="projectname">ROOMS is a tablet app that empowers Endava employees to use the office meeting rooms with minimal&nbsp;friction.</h1>

    <img id="hero" data-src="images/rooms/rooms_hero.jpg" alt="hero image" class="lazyload">
    <p id="descriptionp1">The problems.  Most Endava employees are making calls with their teams and clients from their desks. So we went on a mission to move those calls to designated meeting&nbsp;rooms. <br><br>
      That would allow them&nbsp;to:<br><br>
      1. collaborate better in a more private&nbsp;environment. <br><br>
      2. to not disturb their colleagues working on separate projects from the same open space&nbsp;floor.</p>
    <p id="descriptionp2">The solution. A tablet device was installed at the entrance of each meeting room which would run the Rooms&nbsp;App.<br><br> 
      That tablet would work as the room’s interface. It would show its status, for how long it is available, what meeting takes place at the moment, when does the current meeting end, what’s the next meeting, when does it start and some more. All of it is entirely related to that specific meeting&nbsp;room.<br><br>
      My role. I was responsible for the whole experience and the visual direction of&nbsp;the&nbsp;app.</p>
    <!-- <h3>Longer meetings with email invites can only be created from the calendar app inside Outlook or Microsoft&nbsp;Teams, while the impromptu meetings can be created directly from the room&nbsp;tablets.</h3> -->
